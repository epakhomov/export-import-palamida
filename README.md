# export-import-palamida
A set of scripts that iterates over all projects and workspaces in the Palamida system for a given team, writes the list of project and associated workspaces and their scanpaths to two separate files in disk. Then creates project and associated workspaces and kicks off the scan with the default settings for all of them.
